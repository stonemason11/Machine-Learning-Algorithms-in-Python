Majority of the algorithms are implemented by myself from scratch based on the theory from the reference,
unless otherwise noted in the scripts. For each algorithm there will be a notebook test document and a 
clean python script. 

The algorithms implemented in this repository include:
	1. Adaboost
	2. Adaptive Projected Subgradient Method (APSM)
	3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
	4. Compressed Sensing Matching Pursuit (CSMP)
	5. Decision tree
	6. Fuzzy C Means
	7. Hierarchical and DBSCAN Clustering
	8. Iterative Shrinkage/Thresholding (IST) algorithms
	9. Kernal PCA
	10. K-means family
	11. KNN
	12. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
	13. Linear Regression
	14. Logistic Regression
	15. Multipule layer ANN
	16. Naive Bayes
	17. Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)
	18. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
	19. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	20. The Primal Estimated Subgradient Solver for SVM (PEGASOS)
	21. Perceptron
	22. Sequential feature selection (SBS)

Some applications of the algorithms, such as sentiment analysis using ANN, are not listed in here. But please explore.
